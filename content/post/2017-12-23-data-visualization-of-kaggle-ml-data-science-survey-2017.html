<div id="python-vs-r" class="section level1">
<h1>Python vs R</h1>
<p>This is my first ever data analysis on my blog and I’m excited to show what I have worked on with the Kaggle ML and Data Science Survey 2017. For those of you not familiar with this survey, “Kaggle conducted an industry-wide survey to establish a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The survey received over 16,000 responses and we learned a ton about who is working with data, what’s happening at the cutting edge of machine learning across industries, and how new data scientists can best break into the field.” Source: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017">Kaggle ML and Data Science Survey 2017</a>.</p>
<p>I will primarily be using the multiple choice responses. I am definitely open to any feedback on my code and any ideas for more visualizations! I want to make more visualizations of this dataset that generate better insights in the battle between Python and R.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="data-visualizations-i-will-be-walking-you-through" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Visualizations I will be walking you through:</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Barchart of responses to a question of job skill importance between Python and R</li>
<li>Barchart of Job Satisfaction of Code Writers vs Non code writers</li>
<li>Barchart of Work tools frequency between Python and R</li>
<li>Density Plot of Compensation for Recommended Languages</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code># Load the most important package in R
library(tidyverse)

# Read in kaggle multiple choice data
kaggle_mc &lt;- read_csv(&quot;kaggle_mc.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="purpose-of-below-graph" class="section level2">
<h2>Purpose of below graph:</h2>
<p>I visualize how Kagglers responded to the survey question: How important do you think the below skills or certifications are in getting a data science job? The skills: Fluent in R / Python</p>
<pre class="r"><code>kaggle_mc %&gt;% 
  select(JobSkillImportancePython, JobSkillImportanceR) %&gt;% 
# tidy the data so that there is a column with language and  another column with responses
  gather(coding_lang, response, JobSkillImportancePython, JobSkillImportanceR) %&gt;%  
  filter(!is.na(response)) %&gt;% 
# Let&#39;s draw a barchart of the responses segmented by the programming language
  ggplot(aes(x = response)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = coding_lang), position = &quot;dodge&quot;) +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title=&quot;Coding Languages&quot;)) +
  xlab(&quot;Responses&quot;)</code></pre>

<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="reasoning" class="section level2">
<h2>Reasoning:</h2>
<p>More people responded “Necessary” to Python as the data science skill important to getting a data science job.
More people responded “Nice to have” and “Unnecessary” to R as the data science skill important for employment.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="key-takeaway-of-above-graph" class="section level2">
<h2>Key Takeaway of above graph:</h2>
<p>Learning (knowing) Python is absolutely necessary to getting a data science job while learning (knowing) R is secondary in its importance. I agree with this result based upon Stack Overflow Data Scientist David Robinson’s blog posts: <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/">The Incredible Growth of Python</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/14/python-growing-quickly/">Why is Python Growing So Quickly?</a></p>

<div id="purpose-of-below-graph-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Purpose of below graph:</h2>
<p>I look at <em>current</em> job satisfaction of code writers vs non-code writers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>kaggle_mc %&gt;% 
  select(CodeWriter, JobSatisfaction) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = JobSatisfaction)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = CodeWriter), position = &quot;dodge&quot;) +
  coord_flip() +
xlab(&quot;Job Satisfaction Score&quot;) +
ylab(&quot;Count&quot;) +
guides(fill=guide_legend(title=&quot;Code Writer?&quot;)) </code></pre>

<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="key-takeaway-from-above-graph" class="section level2">
<h2>Key Takeaway from above graph:</h2>
<p>Non-coders did not respond to the job satisfaction question; it is hard to comment on the job satisfaction of non-coders. On the other hand, the job satisfaction of coders is skewed to the left. Thus, coders are mostly satisfied with their <em>current</em> jobs.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="purpose-of-below-graph-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Purpose of below graph:</h2>
<p>I find work tools frequency between Python and R.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>kaggle_mc %&gt;% 
  select(WorkToolsFrequencyPython, WorkToolsFrequencyR) %&gt;% 
  filter(!is.na(WorkToolsFrequencyPython), !is.na(WorkToolsFrequencyR)) %&gt;% 
  # tidy the data so that we have one column with the coding language and another column with the frequency of usage.
  gather(coding_lang, frequency, WorkToolsFrequencyPython, WorkToolsFrequencyR) %&gt;% 
 # plot a barchart of frequency segmented by coding languages 
ggplot(aes(x = frequency)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = coding_lang), position = &quot;dodge&quot;) +
xlab(&quot;Frequency&quot;) +
guides(fill=guide_legend(title=&quot;Worktools&quot;)) </code></pre>

<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="key-takeaway" class="section level2">
<h2>Key Takeaway:</h2>
<p>In the “Most of the time” and “Often” responses, Python has a slight edge over R while in the “Rarely” and “Sometimes” responses, it is R with the advantage. I think I can infer Python is used more than R in the workplace. This makes sense. From what I’ve read on Linkedin, Twitter, and blog posts, Python is used more than R in industry while the usage of R increases in academia.</p>

<div id="purpose-of-below-graph-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Purpose of below graph:</h2>
<p>I find the difference of compensation among different <em>recommended</em> coding languages, which are determined based on the survey question: What programming language would you recommend a new data scientist learn first?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggridges) # A graphing library that adds life to the ggplot

kaggle_mc_comp &lt;- kaggle_mc %&gt;%

<h2>Key Takeaway from above graph:</h2>
<p>It is hard to tell the difference in height of these density plots. I may have to find another plot (boxplots?). However, what I do see is that there are some who recommend Julia and earn approximately $1 million USD. These may be outliers.</p>
