# NBA Optical Tracking System: STATS SportVU

.pull-left[

- Tracks 2-D locations of every player on court (x-y coordinates) as well as 3-D coordinates of ball (x,y,z coordinates).


- 25 times a second 


- 72,000 times a game


- 1 billion times a season.

# Expected Possession Value (EPV)

--

- **Multi-resolution model**

--

- Macrotransition & Microtransition models are **combined** to account for discrete and continuous nature of the sport

--

- _Macrotransition_: passes, shots, turnovers. 

--


- _Microtransition_: every other movement that players make with ball.
