abstract: We will be exploring the powerful capabilities of R in a learning analytics context by walking through some of our own completed projects. We'll then let you get your hands dirty working in R on a real-world learning analytics project that will give you a sense of what it is like to do research using R. We will also talk about the amazing resources that are available to learn R so that you can put yourself on the fast-track to using this amazing tool.
